# Addon/Extension support

> With the introduction of Extensions in Blender 4.2, the old way of creating add-ons is considered deprecated.

[Extensions](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.2/advanced/extensions/getting_started.html) are supported.
For general comparison visit [Legacy vs Extension Add-ons](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.2/advanced/extensions/addons.html#legacy-vs-extension-add-ons).
VS code uses the automatic logic to determine if you are using addon or extension:

| Blender version | Addon has `blender_manifest.toml` | Development location:  | Your addon is interpreted as: | Link is created?                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Pre 4.2         | Does not matter                   | ADDON_DEFAULT_LOCATION | Legacy addon                  | No link is created                                 |
| Pre 4.2         | Does not matter                   | Anywhere on disk.      | Legacy addon                  | You addon is linked to ADDON_DEFAULT_LOCATION      |
| 4.2 and above   | True                              | Anywhere on disk.      | Extension                     | You addon is linked to EXTENSIONS_DEFAULT_LOCATION |
| 4.2 and above   | True                              | ADDON_DEFAULT_LOCATION | Legacy addon                  | No link is created                                 |
| 4.2 and above   | True                              | ANY_REPO_LOCATION      | Extension                     | No link is created                                 |
| 4.2 and above   | False                             | Does not apply.        | Legacy addon                  | You addon is linked to ADDON_DEFAULT_LOCATION      |

There is no setting to override this behaviour. Find out your default paths:
```python
>>> ADDON_DEFAULT_LOCATION = bpy.utils.user_resource("SCRIPTS", path="addons")
'/home/user/.config/blender/4.2/scripts/addons'
>>> ANY_REPO_LOCATION = [repo.custom_directory if repo.use_custom_directory else repo.directory for repo in bpy.context.preferences.extensions.repos if repo.enabled]
['/home/user/.config/blender/4.2/extensions/blender_org', '/home/user/.config/blender/4.2/extensions/user_default', '/snap/blender/5088/4.2/extensions/system']
>>> EXTENSIONS_DEFAULT_LOCATION = bpy.utils.user_resource("EXTENSIONS", path="vscode_development")
'/home/user/.config/blender/4.2/extensions/vscode_development' 
```

Note: `EXTENSIONS_DEFAULT_LOCATION` is defined by [`blender.addon.extensionsRepository`](vscode://settings/blender.addon.extensionsRepository) 

## Examples

I am using Blender 3.0 to develop my addon in `/home/user/blender-projects/test_extension/`.
My addon supports addons and extensions (has both `bl_info` defined in `__init__.py` and `blender_manifest.toml` file.)
- Result: my addon is interpreted to be addon (because Blender 3 does not support extension). My addon is linked to ADDON_DEFAULT_LOCATION

I am using Blender 4.2 to develop my addon in `/home/user/blender-projects/test_extension/`.
My addon supports addons and extensions (has both `bl_info` defined in `__init__.py` and `blender_manifest.toml` file.)
- Result: my addon is interpreted to be extension. My addon is linked to EXTENSIONS_DEFAULT_LOCATION

# Uninstall addon and cleanup

Uninstalling addons:

- Manually remove links from locations:
  - Extensions (Blender 4.2 onwards): `bpy.utils.user_resource("EXTENSIONS", path="vscode_development")`
  - Addons: `bpy.utils.user_resource("SCRIPTS", path="addons")`
  - For older installations manually remove links from: `bpy.utils.user_resource("EXTENSIONS", path="user_default")`
- Do not use Blender UI to uninstall addons:
    - On windows uninstalling addon with Blender Preferences will result in data loss. It does not matter if your addon is linked or you are developing in directory that Blender recognizes by default (see above table).
    - On linux/mac from blender [2.80](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/e6ba760ce8fda5cf2e18bf26dddeeabdb4021066) uninstalling **linked** addon with Blender Preferences is handled correctly. If you are developing in that Blender recognizes by default (see above table) data loss will occur.

Cleanup:
- Remove installed dependencies in path: `bpy.utils.user_resource("SCRIPTS", path="addons")`
  - Older version install dependencies to global Blender packages folder and they are impossible to remove easily `<blender-install-path>/4.2/python/Lib/site-packages`
- Remove extension repository called `vscode_development`: `Blender -> Preferences -> Get Extensions -> Repositories (dropdown, top right)`
